Hi V, excellent report. Lots of great work you folks are doing on ESMValTool to make it cope with the complex heterogeneous world that it inhabits. I only have typo-related comments as it looks comprehensive.

There are lots of writing-style issues that came up from me running Grammarly, but I don't reckon they are relevant to the readability or utility of the report. Nice work!
